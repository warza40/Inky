# No Slop UI v0.3 Conversion Proof

This artifact exists so a stranger arriving from GitHub, Google, or ChatGPT can see the rule set working in under a minute.

## Scenario

An AI coding agent is asked to build a review queue for an internal operations tool. The user needs to scan items, see status, and run a check.

The common generated result looks flashy but weak: glass panel, decorative gradient, vague command-center copy, oversized radius, fake metric boxes, and no real workflow density.

The no-slop-ui result is plainer: fixed navigation, direct page title, ordinary action button, table rows, subtle borders, and no decorative filler.

## Before Verdict

| Checklist Area | Verdict | Evidence                                                                               |
| -------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product fit    | FAIL    | The generated screen invents metric cards instead of supporting review work.           |
| Layout         | FAIL    | The UI centers one oversized floating panel instead of a real work surface.            |
| Components     | FAIL    | Cards and metric boxes are decorative; no table, filters, or task structure.           |
| Visual style   | FAIL    | Gradient background, frosted panel, large radius, glow/shadow, purple-blue AI palette. |
| Copy           | FAIL    | "Operational clarity" and "Command centre" describe a mood, not a task.                |
| Motion         | PASS    | The compact demo does not include motion.                                              |

Overall: **REVISE**

## After Verdict

| -------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product fit    | PASS    | The screen now centers the review queue task.                                      |
| Layout         | PASS    | Fixed sidebar, stable content area, table-first workflow.                          |
| Components     | PASS    | Ordinary nav, toolbar, button, and table.                                          |
| Visual style   | PASS    | Solid surfaces, subtle borders, restrained radius, no glow or decorative gradient. |
| Copy           | PASS    | Labels name the user's task directly.                                              |
| Motion         | PASS    | No decorative movement required.                                                   |

Overall: **PASS**

## What Changed

- Removed decorative gradient and glass panel.
- Replaced fake metric cards with a real table.
- Replaced vague copy with task labels.
- Reduced radius and shadow strength.
- Added stable sidebar and toolbar dimensions.
- Kept the example small enough to inspect quickly.

## Why This Converts Better

People arriving from search or ChatGPT need immediate proof. A rule list is useful, but a before/after artifact shows the taste boundary faster: the repo is not selling a style, it is preventing a predictable agent failure.

The conversion path is now:

1. Land on README.
2. See the proof image.
3. Open the live HTML example.
4. Copy an agent snippet.
5. Use the checklist before accepting generated UI.
