# Evidence - no-slop-ui-v03-conversion

## Build Summary

No Slop UI v0.3 was built as a conversion release. The change set moves the repo from a mostly rules-and-maintenance surface to a stranger-readable adoption path: README proof image, before/after proof document, copy-paste agent snippets, stronger checklist verdicts, and v0.3.0 skill metadata.

## Changed Files

- `README.md` - rewritten top section around quick-start, proof image, checklist, snippets, and adoption path.
- `SKILL.md` - metadata bumped to `0.3.0`.
- `examples/README.md` - expanded example index with proof/snippet docs.
- `examples/review-checklist.md` - expanded into a standalone acceptance artifact with Product Fit, Layout, Components, Visual Style, Motion, Copy, and PASS/REVISE/ESCALATE verdicts.
- `docs/agent-snippets.md` - added snippets for Codex, Claude Code, OpenClaw, Cursor/custom agents, PR review, and brief clauses.
- `docs/conversion-proof.md` - added before/after proof artifact and checklist verdict.
- `assets/no-slop-ui-before-after.svg` - added README visual proof asset.
- `.agent/tasks/no-slop-ui-v03-conversion/spec.md` - frozen acceptance criteria.
